## 1. Linear Algebra

### 1.1 Vectors, Matrices, and Matrix Operations

A simple Python project demonstrating vector and matrix operations using NumPy, including:
- Vector creation and properties
- Matrix creation and basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication)
- Transpose, inverse, identity, and diagonal matrices

### 1.2 Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors, Norm and Projections

Implementing and understanding fundamental linear algebra operations using NumPy: 
- Dot product and Matrix multiplication
- Computing Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
- Understanding computations of Norm and Projections 

### 1.3 Matrix Decomposition (SVD, PCA Basics)

Implementing and understanding matrix factorization techniques and dimensionality reduction using NumPy:

#### Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
- Factorizes a matrix into: U (left vectors), S (singular values), Vᵀ (right vectors)
- Useful for compression, noise removal, and understanding matrix structure.

#### PCA Basics Using SVD
- Center the data
- Apply SVD
- Take top principal components from Vᵀ
- Project data into lower dimension

## Calculus

### 2.1 Derivatives and Partial Derivatives, Gradient and Gradient Descent
Understanding how functions change using derivatives and gradients, and applying gradient descent for basic optimization tasks using SymPy: 
- Compute derivatives and partial derivatives to see how functions change.
- Use gradients to find directions of steepest change.
- Apply gradient descent to minimize a loss function and optimize weights in machine learning.
